# Quake2_Rose
Quake 2: Window of Retaliation, The Armageddon Device - KMQuake 2 port.

I always loved addons from these authors and always wanted to re-run them on an engine with improved graphics (for example, on KMQuake 2), however, the authors did not publish the mod sources, so I took the liberty of recreating the content contained in gamex86.dll from scratch (and namely weapons, monsters and some scripts.). More than a week of hard work - and the result is an almost complete copy (with the exception of some differences, about which a little later).
