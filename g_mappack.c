Spawns a user defined model, you can specify whether its solid, if so how big the box is, and apply nearly
any effect to the entity.

Spawnflags:
	TOGGLE		Start active, when triggered become inactive
	NOT_IR		The model won't be tinted red when the player has IR goggles on
	PLAYER		Set this if you want to use a player model
	NO_MODEL	Don't use a model. Usefull for placing particle effects and dynamic lights on their own
	ANIM__ONCE	Only play the animation once
-----------------------
Key/Value pairs:
"style" Specifies the animation type to use.
   0: None (unless startframe and framenumbers are used)
   1: ANIM01 - cycle between frames 0 and 1 at 2 hz
   2: ANIM23 - cycle between frames 2 and 3 at 2 hz
   3: ANIM_ALL - cycle through all frames at 2 hz
   4: ANIM_ALLFAST - cycle through all frames at 10 hz

Note: The animation flags override startframe and framenumbers settings you may have enterered. ANIM_ALL and ANIM_ALLFAST don't do what you might think - rather than setting a framerate, these apparently cause the model to cycle through its ENTIRE sequence of animations in 0.5 or 0.1 seconds... which for monster and player models is of course not possible. Looks exceptionally goofy. 

"usermodel"		The model to load (models/ is already coded)
"startframe"	The starting frame : default 0
"framenumbers"  The number of frames you want to display after startframe
"skinnum"		The skin number to use, default 0
"health"		If non-zero and solidstate is 3 or 4 (solid), the entity will be shootable. When destroyed, it blows up with a no-damage explosion. 
"solidstate" 
	1 - not solid at all. These models do not obey any sort of physics. If you place them up in the air or embedded in a wall they will stay there and be perfectly happy about it. 
	2 - solid. These models will "droptofloor" when spawned. If the health value is set they may be damaged. 
	3 - solid. Same as above but not affected by gravity. Model will remain in the same location. 
	4 - not solid but affected by gravity. Model will "droptofloor" when spawned. 
NOTE : if you want the model to be solid then you must enter vector values into the following fields :
"bleft" = the point that is at the bottom left of the models bounding box in a model editor
"tright" = the point that is at the top left of the models bounding box in a model editor

/*QUAKED model_train (1 0 0) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) START_ON TOGGLE BLOCK_STOPS PLAYER NO_MODEL ROTATE ROT_CONST SMOOTH
A moving model. The "team" key allows you to team train entities together.

Spawnflags:
	PLAYER		Set this if you want to use a player model
	NO_MODEL	Don't use a model. Usefull for placing particle effects and	dynamic lights on their own
	SPLINE: If set, the func_train will follow a spline curve between path_corners. What this means is you can create near perfectly smooth curvilinear paths with a handful of path_corners. The train will constantly turn to face the direction it is moving (unless yaw_speed and pitch_speed are negative values). For a couple of examples, see the rottrain and lcraft example maps (available on the downloads page.) The shape of the spline curve is controlled by the location and pitch and yaw angles of the train's path_corners. Train roll angle will vary linearly between path_corner roll angle values (the third component of the angles vector).
