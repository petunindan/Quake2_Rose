Story
=====

    A group of power-hungry Humans haved allied with the Strogg. 
Together they are planting small worm-hole devices in various
areas on Earth itself! History has shown that the worst threat
to man is often man himself, but Humans and Strogg together?
They must be stopped immediately! Intelligence has confirmed they have
developed 5 of these worm-holes, or Star-ports.
The questions is WHERE are they.
    One is rumoured to be hidden in some obscure, abandoned park area
somewhere in San Francisco;Troops are already searching GolenGate 
Park and a few other well-known larger parks.
    You will go in with one of those regiments searching the less-
known parks. Its believed whoever finds this Star-port can then
locate the other 4 to enable a quick crippling blow to this Strogg/
Human threat! 


Good luck soldier! 



Weapons
=======

All the usual quake2 weapons are available to you on this
mission. There have also been some new weapons developed
since the original conflict.
Some of these weapons were available in our previous missions
"Window Of Retaliation" and "The Armaggedon Device"

a) Air Force Issue Blaster.   This is a slighly more
   powerful weapon than the one issued to ground forces.
   It fires two blaster bolts in quick succession.
   Requires no ammo. Always available.
b) Proximity grenades. These can be thrown to set a trap
   for an enemy. A prox grenade will detonate after 1
   minute or when an enemy wanders too close.
   They cannot be used in the grenade launcher.
   This weapon is available on button 6 which it
   shares with the standard grenade launcher.
   Hand grenades without the proximity fuse are
   still available.
   Prox grenades are recogniseable due to the yellow
   stripe around their top.
c) Feedback Laser. This weapon uses a modified railgun
   casing, to house a powerful laser whose pulse can
   be fed back into the excitation chamber to increase
   its power.
   This weapon is immensly powerful but tricky to aim
   and control.
   To charge the weapon, keep your finger on the fire
   button. You will see the charge state as a percentage
   figure on your HUD. When you release the fire button
   the laser will fire.
   BEWARE. Overcharge the weapon and it will explode.
   You have been warned soldier!
   This weapon is available on button 9 which it shares
   with the railgun.
d) Plasma Gun. This weapon fires a torus of superheated 
   gas at a rapid rate. It has a small radius damage and
   is powerful when a concentrated burst of fire is laid
   down.

   Thanks to the Loki's Missions team for kindly letting
   us use their Plasma Gun model, although the effects and
   sounds are ours!
   



Enemies
=======

Some of these monsters also appeared in our previous
missions.


You will find the following new enemies along with all the
existing quake2 monsters.

a) Soldier StormTrooper

a highly trained soldier armed with a machine gun, a power 
screen and an attitude. Not the usual cannon fodder.

b) Flyer Hornet

nasty variant of the flyer. Easily recognisable due to
its wasp stripes, this monster packs the punch of a 
railgun and is defended by a power screen.

It has one disadvantage. The generator used to power
its shield cannot be cooled properly on such a small
frame. Overload the shield and it will explode.
The resulting smoking and glowing hornet is then an
easy target.

c) Laser Gladiator

Power shielded and carrying a Feedback Laser, these 
guys are fast and hard to kill. Beware.

d) Death Tank.

A Faster and more aggresive tank. Armed with a plasma
gun and a wicked pulse laser these guys really pack a
punch. Look for the skull and crossbones on the breastplate.

e) Prox Parasite.

Parasite with a habit of dropping a proximity grenade. 
Watch where you step.

f) Traitor and Female Traitor.

Human traitors. Chaingun totting, tough and usually
in groups.

g) Traitor Boss.

The problem with using human DNA. She was cunning
enough to usurp her creators and rise to the
top of the Strogg Hierarchy. She is also a
scientific genius and has harnessed the Strogg 
technology to full effect. 

Beware. She can use a personal cloaking device and
any weapon she chooses. Expect her to decloak, fire
and then re-cloak before you can counter attack.

bad bad trouble....

Muliplayer
==========


The Feedback Laser is a great DM weapon over a
LAN and can be used in two modes. 
a) Standard mode where you charge up the 
weapon and fire at a high charge percentage.
b) Pulse mode. Just fire like a normal weapon.
The reload time is very short so you can lay
down a barrage of laser fire. Quite effective.
The Feedback Laser can be tricky to use over 
the Internet. Beware of accidentaly overcharging
and blowing yourself up!

Proximity Grenades can be used in DM but unlike
in single player, you only pick up 1 at a time 
in DM.

The plasma gun is great fun!

If you require more than 8 players, the following
maps are the largest.

Hints
=====

1. Just shoot the Star-ports...nothing tricky;They do not even explode
but rather just sort of shatter.
