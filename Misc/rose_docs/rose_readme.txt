Story
=====

Two years after the victory against the Strogg cyborgs, Earth 
forces are still mopping up pockets of Strogg resistance on
outlying planets and moons.
You are a pilot of a ground attack fighter bomber, attached 
to the 3rd fleet patrolling the nebula on the edge of the 
Strogg system. Your commanders seem worried, there have been
rumours of a new Strogg threat and a hidden base. 
The carrier you fly from has just detected a huge artificial
energy source on a nearby planet. Already troop ships have
been summoned and your squadron is to fly a scout mission
close to the energy source. Everyone is nervous, this seems
more dangerous than other planets....

You are at 1000 feet and mach 1, the sky around you suddenly
lights up with green laser discharges, your wingman is 
destroyed in one shot and debris from his plane smashes your
control surfaces. Your going down, you can see signs of a base
below, and maybe you could make a forced landing if you could 
just get the nose to rise a little.. got to clear that wall...



Weapons
=======

All the usual quake2 weapons are available to you on this
mission. There have also been some new weapons developed
since the original conflict.

a) Air Force Issue Blaster.   This is a slighly more
   powerful weapon than the one issued to ground forces.
   It fires two blaster bolts in quick succession.
   Requires no ammo. Always available.
b) Proximity grenades. These can be thrown to set a trap
   for an enemy. A prox grenade will detonate after 1
   minute or when an enemy wanders too close.
   They cannot be used in the grenade launcher.
   This weapon is available on button 6 which it
   shares with the standard grenade launcher.
   Hand grenades without the proximity fuse are
   still available.
   Prox grenades are recogniseable due to the yellow
   stripe around their top.
c) Feedback Laser. This weapon uses a modified railgun
   casing, to house a powerful laser whose pulse can
   be fed back into the excitation chamber to increase
   its power.
   This weapon is immensly powerful but tricky to aim
   and control.
   To charge the weapon, keep your finger on the fire
   button. You will see the charge state as a percentage
   figure on your HUD. When you release the fire button
   the laser will fire.
   BEWARE. Overcharge the weapon and it will explode.
   You have been warned soldier!
   This weapon is available on button 9 which it shares
   with the railgun.


Enemies
=======

The Strogg cyborg developers were severly curtailed by the 
defeat on the Strogg home world. However they have attempted 
to modify existing designs to try and gain an edge of the 
humans. 

You will find the following new enemies along with all the
existing quake2 monsters.

a) Soldier StormTrooper

a highly trained soldier armed with a machine gun, a power 
screen and an attitude. Not the usual cannon fodder.

b) Flyer Hornet

nasty variant of the flyer. Easily recognisable due to
its wasp stripes, this monster packs the punch of a 
railgun and is defended by a power screen.

It has one disadvantage. The generator used to power
its shield cannot be cooled properly on such a small
frame. Overload the shield and it will explode.
The resulting smoking and glowing hornet is then an
easy target.

c) Laser Gladiator

Power shielded and carrying a Feedback Laser, these 
guys are fast and hard to kill. Beware.

d) Tank General.

Shielded and tough tank. Not fast but tough,
especially in groups.

e) Hypertank.

The end boss.

Muliplayer
==========

Window Of Retaliation was designed to provide
hours of Deathmatch fun once the single player
mission is completed.
All maps are tuned to keep the Deathmatch areas
small so 2-8 people is an ideal number.

The Feedback Laser is a great DM weapon over a
LAN and can be used in two modes. 
a) Standard mode where you charge up the 
weapon and fire at a high charge percentage.
b) Pulse mode. Just fire like a normal weapon.
The reload time is very short so you can lay
down a barrage of laser fire. Quite effective.
The Feedback Laser can be tricky to use over 
the Internet. Beware of accidentaly overcharging
and blowing yourself up!

Proximity Grenades can be used in DM but unlike
in single player, you only pick up 1 at a time 
in DM.

If you require more than 8 players, the following
maps are the largest.

Window Of Retaliation supports co-op play.


 
Hints
=====

THIS SECTION CONTAINS SPOILERS 
DONT READ UNLESS YOU ARE STUCK

1. "Nice Landing!"
To get into the underground base from the crash site
you must jump onto the walkway over the ventilation
fan, shoot the grill off the maintenance hatch, 
crouch, walk to the end and drop down.
Then shoot off the grill beneath you feet.

2. "Lower Data Center"
To locate the computer core you must shoot out the
grill in the coolant supply pipe. This will cause
the primary coolant system to explode, opening
a hole into the floor below.
The coolant supply pipe is in the right hand of
the two pools in the large hall.

3. "Mohole railway"
The power cube is carried by an enemy.
