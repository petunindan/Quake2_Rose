Installation
============

1. Unzip the tadq2.zip file into a directory on your hard disk.
2. Run the setup.exe from that directory.

Note. When you are prompted for the quake2 directory be sure to
enter the correct path. Eg. C:\QUAKE2
Do not enter a sub directory below your quake2 directory.

3. Setup will add a new start menu folder "TADQ2"


Story
=====

Heading for Earth is an asteroid half the size of the moon. 
When it hits, all life on Earth will be destroyed.
This is no ordinary chunk of planetary debris. This rock
has a primitive fusion drive and the most powerful shield 
we have ever seen. It is a weapon. It is the Stroggs last
hope of victory.
It is "The Armageddon Device"!
A warship from Earth captured a Strogg shuttle en-route for
the asteroid and interrogated the crew. This is what they 
learned;
The shield is generated and controlled from a reactor on the
rock itself. No one Strogg knows the deactivation code.
There are three Strogg commanders who know 2 digits each of
the six digit code. We do not expect them to volunteer to 
pass the code to us!
This is your mission soldier.
1) You will be taken to the calculated start position of
the asteroid. There is a class m planet there, and we
anticipate finding a Strogg colony.
2) Your captain will scan the surface and locate the best
spot for a covert insertion.
3) You will lead a small team of 4 and attempt to obtain
the deactivation code from the Strogg Commanders. Your
battlefield computer has been adapted to read the Strogg
cerebral implants and extract the code. This cannot be 
done while its owner is alive.
4) When you have the code, you must find a way to get
onto the asteroid and deactivate the shield.
5) An Earth warship will then destroy the rock with
thermonuclear charges.

Good luck soldier! 



Weapons
=======

All the usual quake2 weapons are available to you on this
mission. There have also been some new weapons developed
since the original conflict.
Some of these weapons were available in our previous mission
"Window Of Retaliation"

a) Air Force Issue Blaster.   This is a slighly more
   powerful weapon than the one issued to ground forces.
   It fires two blaster bolts in quick succession.
   Requires no ammo. Always available.
b) Proximity grenades. These can be thrown to set a trap
   for an enemy. A prox grenade will detonate after 1
   minute or when an enemy wanders too close.
   They cannot be used in the grenade launcher.
   This weapon is available on button 6 which it
   shares with the standard grenade launcher.
   Hand grenades without the proximity fuse are
   still available.
   Prox grenades are recogniseable due to the yellow
   stripe around their top.
c) Feedback Laser. This weapon uses a modified railgun
   casing, to house a powerful laser whose pulse can
   be fed back into the excitation chamber to increase
   its power.
   This weapon is immensly powerful but tricky to aim
   and control.
   To charge the weapon, keep your finger on the fire
   button. You will see the charge state as a percentage
   figure on your HUD. When you release the fire button
   the laser will fire.
   BEWARE. Overcharge the weapon and it will explode.
   You have been warned soldier!
   This weapon is available on button 9 which it shares
   with the railgun.
d) Plasma Gun. This weapon fires a torus of superhearted 
   gas at a rapid rate. It has a small radius damage and
   is powerful when a concentrated burst of fire is laid
   down.

   Thanks to the Loki's Missions team for kindly letting
   us use their Plasma Gun model when our model maker
   had to duck out.



Enemies
=======

Some of these monsters also appeared in our previous
mission "Window Of Retaliation"

The Strogg cyborg developers were severly curtailed by the 
defeat on the Strogg home world. However they have attempted 
to modify existing designs to try and gain an edge of the 
humans. 
They have also managed to obtain some human DNA from the
bodies of soldiers on Stroggos. There are rumours that
they have begun to make human servants in their cloning
vats.

You will find the following new enemies along with all the
existing quake2 monsters.

a) Soldier StormTrooper

a highly trained soldier armed with a machine gun, a power 
screen and an attitude. Not the usual cannon fodder.

b) Flyer Hornet

nasty variant of the flyer. Easily recognisable due to
its wasp stripes, this monster packs the punch of a 
railgun and is defended by a power screen.

It has one disadvantage. The generator used to power
its shield cannot be cooled properly on such a small
frame. Overload the shield and it will explode.
The resulting smoking and glowing hornet is then an
easy target.

c) Laser Gladiator

Power shielded and carrying a Feedback Laser, these 
guys are fast and hard to kill. Beware.

d) Death Tank.

A Faster and more aggresive tank. Armed with a plasma
gun and a wicked pulse laser these guys really pack a
punch. Look for the skull and crossbones on the breastplate.

e) Prox Parasite.

Parasite with a habit of dropping a proximity grenade. 
Watch where you step.

f) Traitor and Female Traitor.

Human traitors. Chaingun totting, tough and usually
in groups.

g) Traitor Boss.

The problem with using human DNA. She was cunning
enough to usurp her creators and rise to the
top of the Strogg Hierarchy. She is also a
scientific genius and has harnessed the Strogg 
technology to full effect. 

Beware. She can use a personal cloaking device and
any weapon she chooses. Expect her to decloak, fire
and then re-cloak before you can counter attack.

bad bad trouble....

Muliplayer
==========

The Armageddon Device was designed to provide
hours of Deathmatch fun once the single player
mission is completed.
All maps are quite small so 
2-8 people is an ideal number.

The Armageddon Device has Quake3 style
head up player Id display.

The Feedback Laser is a great DM weapon over a
LAN and can be used in two modes. 
a) Standard mode where you charge up the 
weapon and fire at a high charge percentage.
b) Pulse mode. Just fire like a normal weapon.
The reload time is very short so you can lay
down a barrage of laser fire. Quite effective.
The Feedback Laser can be tricky to use over 
the Internet. Beware of accidentaly overcharging
and blowing yourself up!

Proximity Grenades can be used in DM but unlike
in single player, you only pick up 1 at a time 
in DM.

The plasma gun is great fun!

If you require more than 8 players, the following
maps are the largest.

space1.bsp "Strogg Cruiser"
polar2.bsp "Polar Comm Center"
polar3.bsp "Polar Command"

The Armageddon Device supports co-op play.


 
Hints
=====

1. If a message tells you to remember 
   something write it down! If you have not
   remembered the deactivation code you will
   not be able to finish the mission.
